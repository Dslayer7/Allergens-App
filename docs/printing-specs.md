# Food Tag Printing Specifications

This document outlines the printing dimensions for the food tags generated by the AllergenWise application.

## Paper and Card Dimensions

- **Total Paper Size:** 13cm (height) x 9cm (width)
- **Folded Front Face:** The paper is folded in half, resulting in a visible front face of 6.5cm (height) x 9cm (width).

## Layout Requirements

- **Bottom Margin:** A margin of 1.8cm must be reserved at the bottom of the front face. This area is designated for placing a hotel logo (e.g., Swiss√¥tel).

## Digital Representation

To approximate these physical dimensions in the web preview, we use the following logic:

- The aspect ratio is **9 : 6.5** (width : height).
- The bottom margin (1.8cm) is approximately **27.7%** of the total height (6.5cm). This is implemented in the `FoodTagCard` component.
